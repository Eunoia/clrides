wanted,I need a ride to the midwest!,(Trying to get to Ohio!  )    Hey there!  I'm a traveling musician and I'm looking for a ride from the Seattle or Portland area sometime after March 20th to the Cleveland area.  A little about myself:  I'm originally from New England (CT/MA) I'm in my early 20s and I've been traveling the country for the past six months or so. Five weeks ago I flew from New York to San Francisco and have been traveling up the coast since.  I'm trying to see the country and make new friends and maybe even find a place where I'd like to settle down eventually.  I'm trying to cut across the country to the East coast again but I'd like to stop in Ohio (or someplace close) to visit some friends while on the way.  I REALLY don't want to fly again (the least fun way to travel by far).  I'm presently staying with some good friends in Seattle but I think I'd like to leave here sometime after the 20th.  I can leave from Portland as well if that makes it any easier.  I can pitch in some money for gas and I am a licensed and safe driver and would be happy to split up the driving as well.  I'm only traveling with a backpack so it won't be a problem if space is tight.  Thank you very much!  -Maxwell
